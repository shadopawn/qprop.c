    qprop.c: a simple and lightweight library for propeller aerodynamic analysis

    The blade-element/momentum equations are solved with the method of
    S. Andrew Ning (Wind Energy 17(9), 2014): a bracketed one-dimensional root
    find on the local inflow angle, with momentum theory switched between the
    momentum, empirical (Buhl) and reversed-disk-flow branches. Well-suited for
    rotors that operate at low Reynolds numbers and do not feature complex 3D
    effects; handles propeller, turbine/windmill and descent windmill brake
    operation.

    Key characteristics:
    - Lightweight and portable: contained in a single file with no dependencies
    - No file I/O required: perform analyses and retrieve results without
      writing input files or reading output files
    - Easy to use: simply copy the library into your project directory
    - Accurate airfoil polars: unlike the original QPROP, which requires users
      to tune oversimplified analytic models, qprop.c gets the aerodynamic
      coefficients of the airfoils by interpolating XFoil polars

    This file is a header for the precompiled shared libraries,
    replicating the definitions in qprop.c.
